# Common DB Library

Contains some useful functions for working with databases, including some Generics to reading the data directly into Structs. 

The main motivation for this library is to provide a simple way to read data from a database into a struct, without having to write a lot of boilerplate code, or using a GORM-like library. SQL should be bread and butter knowledge for any developer, and GORM extracts this away from the developer, it's another thing to learn. whilst i think some GORM features are really cool, I don't agree with the approach.  The aim of this library is to make the developer write their own SQL, but then read the data into a struct or GORM like extraction. Sort of a half way house.
